# E-commerce Backend

## Description

This is a backend application created using Node.js, Express, Sequelize, MySQL2 and dotenv where I have used Sequelize to interact with the MySQL database and created APIs to run CRUD operations.

## Installation

The project can be installed by cloning the repo from github. Once this is done run npm install to download the dependencies needed for the project. Then run the MySQL shell to create the database. Once the database is created if you are using the seed data run node seeds/seed.js from the terminal to populate the database. Then type in npm start to being the server to test the APIs. I have tested them using Insomnia.

## Usage

The project has GET, POST, PUT and DELETE API routes for different categories, products and tags in this e-commerce store. They can all be used to carry out their relevant operation to amend or view the data in the database.
